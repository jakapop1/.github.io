A text-based fishing game developed for ICS 211.

## Project Overview

The Fishing Game project is a collaborative effort in the context of a computer science course. The objective was to create an interactive two-player fishing tournament game. The game involved the development of a virtual ecosystem where players would take turns catching, collecting, and managing fish. The project aimed to apply object-oriented programming principles and demonstrate proficiency in Java.

## My Role and Contributions

In this project, my primary responsibility was to implement various fish species according to the specifications provided. The fish species I worked on included Weke'ula, Weke'a, Uhu, Pua'ama, Panuhunuhu, Ohua, Oama, Kahaha, and Anae. Each fish had to adhere to the Fishable interface and its associated requirements, such as legal size, bait status, and catch methods.

I also played a crucial role in ensuring that the implemented fish classes integrated seamlessly with the existing codebase. This involved modifying the inheritance hierarchy, updating class methods, and testing the classes to verify their functionality.

Furthermore, I contributed to structuring the core gameplay of the Fishing Tournament. This included implementing the game's main loop, player turns, fish interactions, and the determination of the game's outcome. The game was designed to simulate fishing in a virtual environment, allowing players to make decisions on catching and managing their fish.

## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in object-oriented design and Java programming. I learned how to design and implement a hierarchy of classes that adhered to specific interfaces. This project also improved my problem-solving skills, as I had to tackle various challenges related to fish behavior and game mechanics.

Additionally, I learned the importance of effective collaboration and communication within a development team. We worked together to ensure that our individual contributions integrated smoothly, resulting in a cohesive and functional game.

In conclusion, the Fishing Game project not only expanded my programming skills but also provided insights into project management and teamwork. It served as an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical, hands-on project, and I am proud of the final product we created.
