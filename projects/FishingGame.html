<p>A text-based fishing game developed for ICS 211 with the goal of working in a collaborative environment.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Fishing, a fun past time for many while even a career for others is undoubtedly an event in which has been a part of history for almost as long as humans have existed. As a result, knowing rules and regulations is a must as in most places you must conform to a certain standard on the do’s and dont’s while fishing. In this project, we aim to do just that through the Java command console as we implement the different types of fishes commonly found in Hawaii and the rules that apply when catching them. I invite you to peek at what we’ve created as one of our fun Java project for our ICS 211 class!</p>

<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>

<p>The Fishing Game project is a collaborative project with me and my assigned partners. The objective of this project was to create an interactive two-player fishing tournament game. Some of the requirements for this project involved the development of a virtual ecosystem where players would take turns catching, collecting, and managing fish through the console. The project aimed to apply object-oriented programming principles in order to demonstrate our proficiency in Java that we had learned throughout the semester.</p>

<h2 id="goal-of-the-project">Goal of the Project</h2>

<p>Create a text-driven fishing experience while conforming to some of real world constraints and classifications such as legal fish sizes and seasonal availabilities.</p>

<h2 id="my-role-and-contributions">My Role and Contributions</h2>

<p>In this project, my primary responsibility was to implement various fish species according to the specifications provided. The fish species I worked on included Weke’ula, Weke’a, Uhu, Pua’ama, Panuhunuhu, Ohua, Oama, Kahaha, and Anae. Each fish had to adhere to the Fishable interface and its associated requirements, such as legal size, bait status, and catch methods.</p>

<p>Another of my responsibility was in ensuring that the implemented fish classes integrated seamlessly with the existing codebase. This involved modifying the inheritance hierarchy, updating class methods, and testing the classes to verify their functionality.</p>

<p>At the same time, my partners are doing the same but with different sets of classes representing other families of fishes.</p>

<p>Lastly, my partners and I put the classes together to then structure the core gameplay of the Fishing Tournament. This included implementing the game’s main loop, player turns, fish interactions, and the determination of the game’s outcome while allowing players to make decisions on catching and managing their fish.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>Through this project, I gained a lot of valuable experience in object-oriented design through Java programming. I learned how to design and implement a hierarchy of classes that adhered to specific interfaces. This project also improved my problem-solving skills, as I had to tackle various challenges related to fish behavior and game mechanics.</p>

<p>Additionally, I learned the importance of effective collaboration and communication within a development team. We worked together to ensure that our individual contributions integrated smoothly, resulting in a cohesive and functional game.</p>
