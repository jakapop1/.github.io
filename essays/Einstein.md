## Introduction 

Regarded as the man of the century, Albert Einstein had achieved what had been thought
impossible and shaped the way in which we see the world today. In the early years of his life,
once he had started school young Einstein grew to excel especially in mathematics and science.
Albert had then continued his education and from that point on had never stopped learning. With
emphasis on his early upbringing in mathematics, he had then gone on to make many amazing
discoveries which paved the way for the foundation of society as we see it today.


## Early Life Of Einstein 

When Einstein was a child his early development had not been particularly exceptional as
one might expect of someone regarded as such a prodigy. Albert Einstein was born on March
14th, 1879, in Ulm, Germany (Duckster). Albert had had a slow development as he had not
learned to speak till the age of 5 and thus slower than the average child (Duckster).


Understandably Einstein’s family had then grown concerned. Einstein was not the typical prodigy
who could read or do advanced math at a young age ; however was the opposite as he had great
difficulty learning to speak (Duckster). Nevertheless, Einstein showed great mental discipline at a
young age. Einstein would play by himself for hours, his parents also often taught Einstein to be
self-reliant and supported him making his own decisions (Museum). As young Einstein entered
school, he had developed a rebellious side as he often clashed with his teachers and general
authority (Duckster). As Einstein continued the course of his young education, he had grown to
excel at math and generally performed at the top of his classes for those subject areas
(Duckster).

## Early Interests

While Einstein was not studying mathematics, he often enjoyed music as a past-time. As
a child, young Einstein was not particularly normal as he preferred to play by himself rather than
with his peers (Duckster). As a result of his solitude, Einstein was left with much more time to
himself, Einstein was able to foster his interests while practicing his early independence. Young
Einstein loved to solve puzzles, construct towers with playing cards (Duckster). Einstein had
recalled his past memory that when was at the age of five or six, when he had grown ill, his
father had given him a compass in which in later years and Einstein had lasting effects of that
moment as it started him on his journey of asking questions about the world around him
(Duckster). Einstein also had profound love for music. When he had learned of Mozart he had
fallen in love, as a result with the influence of his mother he had chosen to learn to play the violin
and excelled (Duckster). In his later years, Einstein had quoted “If I were not a physicist, I would
probably be a musician, I often think in music, I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in
terms of music” (Duckster).

## Early Professional Endeavors

Albert Einstein always had a thirst for knowledge even as a young child. At the age of 12,
Einstein had taught himself geometry. Later on he had however failed to qualify to train as an
electrical engineer (StarChild). At that point, he had not given up on his education but rather
continued to develop and follow a new plan for his future. Einstein at that point had decided to
study math and physics so that he could then be a teacher (StarChild). Even though today
people regard Einstein as one of the smartest men in the world, when Einstein had been a newly
graduated teacher of math and physics, his teachers had not thought highly of young Einstein.
As a result, Einstein had a hard time finding jobs as he had trouble getting good
recommendations for a job at a university (StarChild). In the year 1901, he took a job as a high
school teacher and married Mileva Maritsch and had two sons (StarChild). Einstein had not
been particularly close to his first sons as his son Hans Albert had stated “Probably the only
project he ever gave up on was me” (Museum). In the year of 1914, Einstein had separated from
Mileva. Einstein had unfortunately grown ill in the year of 1917 where his cousin Elsa Lowenthal
had nursed him back to health (Museum). As a result, he had fallen in love with the couple
married in the year 1919 (Museum). Einstein then worked for a patent office where he was then
able to publish papers on theoretical physics in which by 1905 Einstein had achieved his Ph.D
(StarChild).

## Milestone Of Einstein's Career

The year 1905 was a very important year for Einstein as in that year he had written a
paper which led to the innovation that we see today. Einsteinstein had written the paper known
as the special theory of relativity (StarChild). The paper had two hypothesis one in which stated
that laws of physics must be relative to another in various forms of reference , and with the
second one stating that the speed of light was constant (StarChild). Following that in the same
year, Einstein had shown that mass and energy were equivalent (StarChild). This discovery
changed our understanding of physics during that period. Einstein had essentially proposed a
new way of thinking about the mechanics of objects reaching the speed of light (English).
Einstein had proposed that two events happening simultaneously could be observed from the
perspective of one (English). After having a greatly successful year, Einstein was then offered
new opportunities which allowed him to further advance his career. Einstein had then become a
lecturer at the University of Bern where he had later transferred to the University of Zurich as a
lecturer (StarChild). In 1911 Einstein had then taught at Carl-Ferdinand University in Prague
where the following year he had returned to Germany to continue on his papers (StarChild).


Regarded as one of Einstein’s most well known papers, in 1916, Einstein published his
general theory of relativity (StarChild). This theory was so impactful because it tied a lot of his
theories together and linked gravitation, acceleration, and the four dimensional space-time
(StarChild). With his profound discovery, Einstein was able to account for the variations in the
orbital motions of the planets (StarChild). He had also predicted that starlight in the proximity of
a massive object could bend which had been proven and confirmed in the year 1919 during a
solar eclipse (StarChild). This theory helped us in our understanding of how the large structure
of the universe is set up (English). Einstein had discovered that the laws of physics are constant
for non accelerating observers and that light will be constant no matter how fast the observer
may be moving through space and time (English). As a result, this led him to discover that
massive objects in space could distort space and time (English). His discoveries were so
impactful that even today, scientists use his theory in studying the black hole and gravitational
lensing (English).


At this point of Einstein’s life, he had much media coverage and public adoration
(StarChild). Essentially, Albert Einstein had been one of the first scientist celebrities as he was
recognized for his work and contribution to science. In the year 1921, he had won the Nobel
Prize for Physics for his work on the photoelectric effect (StarChild). Einstein had introduced to
the world the idea of photons being the particle of light and that the energy the photon has is
proportional to the frequency of the radiation (StarChild). Einstein had also discovered the
existence of atoms thus laying the foundation for Avogadro's number (English). This discovery
shocked the world as Einstein had pretty much discovered another world within our very own
world. He had discovered so while developing his mathematical model for explaining Brownian
motion (English).

## Later Years Of Einstein's Life

During Einstein’s life, he had not only been regarded as a scientist but also a social
activist and a humanitarian (StarChild). Einstein had spoken out against the German
involvement in World War one, as a result in 1920 a demonstration Einstein had given was
interrupted in Berlin (StarChild). During this period, growing criticism of his work grew from
certain Germans due to the fact that he was Jewish (StarChild). In 1930, Einstein had traveled
to the United States in which had led him to a post with the Institute for Advanced Study near
Princeton University in which Einstein had gladly accepted, especially with his situation in
Germany (StarChild). By 1935 Einstein was granted permanent residency in the United States
and became a citizen in 1940 (StarChild). Einstein never went back to Germany. Einstein had
spent his later years dwelling in solitude enjoying music and relaxation (Nobel). On the year
1949, Einstein was in failing health where he later passed away in April 1955 in Princeton
(StarChild).


Albert Einstein had always been against war and was someone who was outspoken
whenever it came to speaking out against the war. “My pacifism is an instinctive feeling, a feeling
that possesses me because the murder of people is disgusting”, wrote Einstein (Calaprice). He
had made it clear that he had zero love for war and violence. Einstein had felt great remorse as
his contribution to physics had led to the creation of the nuclear bomb (Calaprice). He had
believed that it was the responsibility of scientists and policy makers to make the best use of new
discoveries (Calaprice). Even though Einstein’s discovery had led humanity towards the creation
of nuclear bomb, Einstein believed that new invention should rather be used instead to better the
lives of humanity. Years later, Einstein is still honored for his relentless support for peace for
people around the world (Calaprice).

## Impact Of Einstein's Work

After Einstein’s passing, his theories live on today through various inventions which we
use in everyday life. From Einstein’s theory of relativity, known as E equals MC square. This led
to nuclear fusion in which allowed people to utilize it’s energy and also build nuclear bombs (All
7). With nuclear going against Einstein’s pascifist’s views one week prior to his death he had
agreed to have his name appear on a manifesto calling for the end to nuclear weapons
(StarChild). Einstein had also invented one of the basis for quantum physics through his
experimentation (UKEssays). Due to Einstein’s discoveries, he had a direct influence on
inventions such as televisions which has spread to every corner of the globe today (UKEssays).

## Conclusion

Einstein, regarded as man of the century, changed the world in countless ways as his
theories continue to shape our understanding of physics and the world around us. Through his
struggles came his successes as he had dedicated his entire life to his studies. Einstein had a far
from easy path as in the midst of brewing war, Einstein had traversed adversities after adversities
in order to do what he loved and that was to gather more knowledge for human kind. His work on
relativity had laid the scientific stepping stone into the future that we all live in today. Through it
all, our understanding of space, time, gravity, and the universe has been revolutionized thanks to
this one man.
