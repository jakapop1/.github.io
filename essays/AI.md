## Introduction

In this essay, I explore the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, particularly in Software Engineering while taking a lot of my own experiences into consideration. With AI's emergence, it's usage in education is undeniable, and for me in ICS 314, tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and Co-Pilot have changed the way I approach problems. AI, ChatGPT in particular, has played a huge role in enhancing my learning and understanding of software engineering concepts.

## Personal Experience with AI

In ICS 314, I actively utilized AI in many different ways. My main approach was to treat AI as a personal tutor that can help provide me with clarification and guidance on a wide range of problems.
