## Introduction

In this essay, I explore the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, particularly in Software Engineering while taking a lot of my own experiences into consideration. With AI's emergence, it's usage in education is undeniable, and for me in ICS 314, tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and Co-Pilot have changed the way I approach problems. AI, ChatGPT in particular, has played a huge role in enhancing my learning and understanding of software engineering concepts.   

## Personal Experience with AI

In ICS 314, I actively utilized AI in many different ways. My main approach was to treat AI as a personal tutor that can help provide me with clarification and guidance on a wide range of problems.

- **WOD Assignements**: As a routine when doing the WOD assignments, I liked to try things out myself first while at the same time following the instruction guidlines provided and then after watch the video and follow along again from there. Issues however, would arise whether it be from the functionality or improper syntax, I would sometimes spend hours looking around and rewatching the video instructions. As a result, I would turn to ChatGPT to look over the code and see if there are any mistakes and 9 times out of 10, AI would pick up the error very quickly while explaining to me what went wrong.   

- **Practice WODS**: I generally try to stay away from AI as I see the time period as a time for self learning as there are no actual grading involved. I think in the case where you are practicing without any pressure of having to finish, a lot more value is derived when you do the assignment without help.
  
- **In class WODS**: In class WODS are a bit different as they are worth a good bit of my grade. Sometimes under pressure, I tend to rely on ChatGPT to help debug especially when running into errors that I can’t figure out a solution to. At the same time, its like using Google for resources except that the response is more tailored to your needs. I remember when first using underscore functions in our class WOD, I ran into and spent almost the entire alotted time trying to debug a small error in syntax as I was also still realtively new to underscore fucnctions. At that point, I realized that if I wanted to pass, I needed extra resources and turned to Chat GPT which then helped me fix a small error to then get my code to work.   

- **Essays**: I found that AI would be quite useful in gathering ideas on how to approach a question prompt, however my take on using AI for essays is to follow along very loosely. That is due to the fact that if utilized too much, you would lose your writing voice and that wouldnt really be your essay anymore.
  
- **Final Project**:  For the final project, I find myself often relying on Chat GPT to help me debug while at the same time explaining concepts that may have gone over my head throughout the semester. Dissapointingly for the most part, I find that the results it gives are not very useful especially on a larger scale. For example, I tried to create a webscrapping program to gather data for my project, it ended up not working out and wasting a lot of time as I soon realized that there were a lot of discrepencies with the meteor template and things needed to have for the application to work. In trying to use Chat GPT to help debug the issue, I went around in a circle until realizing that I needed a different solution.   

- **Learning Concepts/Tutorials**: I find that AI is very useful in this context as if you don’t understand something, you can ask it to clarify and simplify anything as many times as needed. For example, I had Chat GPT give me various examples of different underscore functions being used to help me better understand it's usage.    
- **Asking a question in class or in Discord**: I haven't used AI to answer questions in class or Discord however I imagine that unless you provide a lot of context, the answers can prove to be unreliable.
  
- **Asking or answering smart-question**: I think AI can definitely prove reliable in the context of asking or answering smart-question as it has access to huge sets of data. I have found that sometimes if I don’t understand something about a question, AI can quickly explain the question or outright give answers quite effortlessly. My example of usage is during our in class WOD where I didn't really fully understand the question prompt given about manipulating a data set. As a result, I asked the Ai to clarify while also asking it questions that I had about the problem so that I could gain more insight into my task.
  
- **Coding Example**: Mentioned previously, my experience in using AI to give coding examples proved very effective in example the Underscore .pluck as it can give me various examples in many cases so that I can truly understand its uses. At the same time, when using it to explain Underscore, I was still quite new to Javascript and couldn’t understand some of the way things were coded and see the different usage helped me greatly in understand the various functions.   

- **Explaining Code**: One of the most useful applications of AI I find very effective is in the way it can explain code. I’ve used it on our meteor template to try and understand more of what is going on and the AI gave amazing results with line by line guide on what is happening. This as a result allowed me to follow along and give me a better sense of the bigger picture.

- **Writing Code**: I think that AI can be very effective on small scale problems however when many files are considered, AI can give ineffective results. For example, when using AI to help me write code on my final project, I found that without the full context of my files, the results were useless and AI is better left to answering questions or debugging small files of code. I think relying on AI too much to write code will be detrimental to learning and self growth.   

- **Documenting Code**: Similar to explaining code, I find that AI can document code very well as in general it builds from small to large scale context. It is able to following along immediately explaining what each part of the code is doing.

- **Quality Assurance**: For quality assurance, AI can be useful in small scale and somewhat useful in larger scales. For example, if there is an eslint error I can’t fix, AI can easily give me solutions but in terms of functionality, if it lacks context, it’s not very good at making recommendations specific to the issue but rather a standard approach to debugging it yourself.
  
- **Learning a new Language**: Another use I found for AI is that it can be used for is learning a new language. Personally, when learning new languages, I find that having Mnemonics help me  greatly in memorization. With AI, I can generate good Mnemonics that I like and agree with instantly leading to higher progress in learning new vocabularies.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding: 
Personally, I think that Ai has improved my learning experience as if utilized properly like a tutor/instructor, you have a source of information always at the ready to be used. At the same time however, using AI can lead to complacency and as a result impact learning very negatively. 
I definitely had to find a balance between getting help and figuring things out on my own as ,for students especially, learning through the process is more important than getting the right answers at the press of a button. While I think that AI should be utilized, new software developers should be cautious in using it as self learning is a crucial step to take when first learning programming as a whole.   


## Practical Applications:
I think that for practical applications, Ai can definitely be used effectively. In example, a real world applications like in HACC. Ai can be used as a partner for guiding users to practical and commonly used approaches to problems and issues while at the same time helping develop a structure to build on. I think depending on the usage, Ai can have a high level of effectiveness however if used carelessly can lead users down a rabbit hole where nothing just works out.   

## Challenges and Opportunities:
The challenges/limitations of ai is the fact that it can’t do everything you want it to but sometimes is instead more of a tutor that can help guide you towards the right answer. For example, in a large scale program where a lot of files are considered, AI can only make assumptions and give you a response that it thinks is correct. As a result, the response end up being completely wrong and out of scope where if you would have just done it yourself you would be a lot better off. I think this provides a lot of room for AI to grow through it’s database/intelligence and it’s applications. I think that if someone were to develop a software where AI can be utilized throughout entire projects thus enabling reference and allowing the AI to pinpoint mistakes and issues easier, AI would be a lot more powerful in software development.   

## Compartive Analysis: 
In traditional learning, a lot of trial and error is taken into considerations like trying out codes over and cover while adjusting to meet requirements/criteria. With AI, you can almost skip that process and go straight to the problem and extract what you should and shouldn’t do. However, if you skip this process and just stick to the solution, then you would get a lot less progress for your time and learn a lot less effectively. 

## Future Considerations:
As ai gets more advanced, you will be able to rely on it more heavily thus there will be a need to adhere to a lot more self discipline on it’s uses so that it does not too heavily undermine the process of self learning.  

## Conclusion:

I think that if used responsibly, AI can be a great augmentation to learning and progression. As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility and I think as AI continues to grow and develop it becomes more powerful. So from the software engineering perspective, AI should be used but students should be careful and use it responsibly as with too much reliance comes complacency in learning growth. I think for future courses, AI should be discussed openly while at the same time instructors should encourage students to learn from it rather than rely.
