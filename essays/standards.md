## Introduction
When first starting on my coding journey, I was overwhelmed by all the ins and outs of programming. Java, my initial language of choice, seemed to be a maze of syntax that I struggled to navigate. The challenge, in retrospect, wasn’t just about the memorization of syntax; it was more so about understanding the underlying structure and logic of the code. Overtime, I had realized (after learning a few more languages) that every programming language has a structure, and by learning the structure, learning the syntaxes becomes a lot more intuitive. As a result, I now understand and appreciate the importance of coding standards. 

## What do Coding Standards do?
Coding standards are more than just a set of rules to bother programmers; they serve as the backbone of a well-structured codebase. While little details like indentation or line spacing may seem trivial (and annoying at times), they play a role in ensuring the code’s readability and maintainability. A well-structured code is not just about functionality; it’s about the code being universally understandable. Clear, readable code is especially important when collaborating with others. If a colleague/partner can quickly understand your code, they can immediately get to work and vice versa. I think that this factor alone is one of the most crucial especially in a professional environment. From my own experience in working on several projects with classmates, I found that sometimes when a code is very unorganized, I found myself taking too long to understand a function that was a lot simpler than it seemed!

## My experience with Eslint
 In transitioning to JavaScript, I was recently introduced to ESLint, a tool which enforces coding standards for my ICS 314 class. So far, Eslint is my favorite among other standards I’ve used, that could also be because of a different IDE from JGrasp to IntelliJ. I found the shortcuts more intuitive while the explanations for errors were a lot clearer and to the point. I found that, for Eslint, it wasn’t just pointing out errors but it was also teaching the best practices. For example, Eslint would suggest declaring a variable as a constant if it wasn’t modified later in the code. It’s a suggestion that makes total sense and that was one of the first thing that stood out for me. I think that these standards not only make the code more efficient but instills a deeper understanding of the language and it’s best practices.

## Importance of Standards
From my experience across various programming languages, I've come to realize that coding standards are instrumental in creating a visual and logical structure for any program. When adhering to it, the code becomes a lot more readable especially when I had first started coding. I used to not keep up with little things like line spacing, indentation, comments but once I followed through with the standards, I had always found myself amazed and satisfied by how much more professional the code looked. 

## Conclusion
In conclusion, coding standards may be underappreciated by some, but definitely deserve a second look especially for those into software development. They ensure that the code is not just functional, but readable, maintainable, and efficient. Not only will these standards teach you about the language but also prepare you for the professional world of development!
